      <p>Quantised inertia predicts the rotation of disc galaxies simply, without dark matter and without adjustment. (McCulloch, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7007">2012</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-017-3128-6">2017</a>).</p>
	  <p>QI also predicts a change in galactic behaviour into the past, not predicted by any other theory which seems to be borne out by recent data (McCulloch, <a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217732317501486">2017</a>).</p>
	  <p>The orbits of wide binaries, stars far apart that are apparently bound gravitationally but should not be, are predicted by QI (McCulloch and Lucio, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10509-019-3615-z">2019</a>). Dark matter cannot be applied to these systems and MoND does not predict them.</p>
	  <p>Quantised inertia predicts that energy focused into small asymmetric or symmetric cavities can produce propellant-less thrust (McCulloch, <a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/propellantless-propulsion-from-quantized-inertia-13923.html">2018</a>). Six labs have tested this. So far, five have shown some thrust (Perez-Diaz et al., 2021; one has not (Neunzig et al., 2021).</p>
	  <p>Spacecraft flying by the Earth for gravitational assists have shown anomalous boosts in speed. QI predicts these (McCulloch, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4159">2008</a>) though later flybys showed no anomaly.</p>
